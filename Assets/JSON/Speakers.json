      "about": "My interest towards computer science sparked when I was working on a women's safety application aimed towards the women welfare in India and since then I have been incessantly working on improving my skills. I stumbled upon machine learning then. I have made several open-source contributions in the field of ML and would continue to do so. I have made successful prototypes like autonomous car, alphabet recognition, cancer classification, gesture recognition using learning models. My ambition is to make valuable contribution towards ML community and leave a message of perseverance and tenacity. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Symantec, India. I am also deeply influenced by literature especially Shakespeare's work. Favorite quote : The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones Julius Caesar (Act III, Scene II) Favorite equation : x²-x+41=0",
